Dropinbase Project Setup Guide
Introduction
This README provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a new Dropinbase project. Dropinbase helps you to quickly set up your project with a structured database. This guide will walk you through the installation process, from global package installation to project initialization and setup.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine
An empty database for the Dropinbase project
Installation Steps
1. Global Package Installation
First, you need to install the Dropinbase package globally. Open your terminal and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install dropinbase -g
2. Initialize a New Project
After the global package is installed, you can initialize a new Dropinbase project with a name of your choice. Replace projectName with the desired project name:

bash
Copy code
dropinbase init projectName
3. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the directory of the project you just created:

bash
Copy code
cd projectName
4. Start the Project
To start the Dropinbase application, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
5. Complete the Installation Steps
Open your web browser and visit https://localhost.
Follow the on-screen installation steps. These steps will guide you through installing the Dropinbase database structure that holds your project design.
Note: At this stage, you'll need to connect to an empty database. You can later add a link to your customer data in this database.

6. Final Steps
Once the installation is complete, reload the web page. You can log in using the following default credentials:

Username: admin
Password: test
Additional Information
Database
The initial database should be empty. You'll have the option to add your customer data to this database later.
